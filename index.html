        <h2>A little more details about me</h2>
        <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Aya Hariri. I lived in Belgium, Canada, and Jordan. My nationality is
            Belgian but I am originally from Syria.
            I am a freelance graphic designer and previously worked in the field of events. I have a secret addiction to
            McDonald's. I love playing video games during my freetime. My favorite game is Call of Duty. A lot of people
            fear things, my biggest fear or pet peeve are birds, specially pigeons! They really scare me!
