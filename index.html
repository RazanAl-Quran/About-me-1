        <h2>A little more details about me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Aya Hariri. I am 27years old! I lived in Belgium, Canada, and Jordan. My nationality is
            Belgian but I am originally from Syria.
            I am a freelance graphic designer and previously worked in the field of events. I have a secret addiction to McDonald's. I love playing video games during my freetime. My favorite game is Call of Duty. A lot of people fear things, my biggest fear or pet peeve are birds, specially pigeons! They really scare me!
